## Time Complex - O(n Log 2n)

The number of comparisons done by Bitonic sort are more than popular sorting algorithms like Merge Sort *[ does O(nLogn) comparisons]*, but Bitonice sort is better for parallel implementation because we always compare elements in predefined sequence and the sequence of comparison doesnâ€™t depend on data. Therefore it is suitable for implementation in hardware and parallel processor array.
Bitonic Sort must be done if number of elements to sort are 2^n. The procedure of bitonic sequence fails if the number of elements are not in aforementioned quantity precisely.
